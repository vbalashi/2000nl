## Codebase Patterns
- App version/build metadata is provided via NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_COMMIT, and NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIMESTAMP (see `apps/ui/next.config.js`) and surfaced with `apps/ui/lib/appVersion.ts`.
- App Router API endpoints live under `apps/ui/app/api/<route>/route.ts` and can opt out of caching via `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Deploy notifications are sent via Telegram in `.github/workflows/deploy-nuc.yml` using `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` secrets.

## 2026-01-24 13:32 - US-056
- Fixed theme toggle icon position from top left to top right header
- Moved theme toggle component in TrainingScreen.tsx from left section (before BrandLogo) to right section (first control in toolbar)
- Files changed: apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header structure: Left = BrandLogo, Right = Controls (Theme → Search → Settings → Hotkeys → Sidebar → Account)
  - Theme toggle component located in TrainingScreen.tsx lines 1728-1745
  - All header controls use same circular button styling pattern
  - TypeScript and tests both pass with this layout change

## 2026-01-26 19:48 - US-078.1
- Added app version/build metadata helper and surfaced version info in Settings (About card) and footer.
- Injected build-time version, commit, and timestamp into Next config and Docker build args.
- Added test cleanup hook for vitest to prevent DOM bleed between tests.
- Files changed: apps/ui/next.config.js, apps/ui/components/training/SettingsModal.tsx, apps/ui/components/training/FooterStats.tsx, apps/ui/lib/appVersion.ts, apps/ui/Dockerfile, apps/ui/vitest.setup.ts, ralph/prd.json, ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION/NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_COMMIT/NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIMESTAMP for build metadata in UI.
  - Add RTL cleanup in vitest setup to avoid duplicate DOM nodes across tests.
  - Settings modal cards accept small informational blocks well for lightweight metadata.

## 2026-01-26 19:52 - US-078.2
- Added /api/health endpoint returning version, commit, uptime, status, and timestamp
- Verified endpoint via curl on localhost
- Files changed: apps/ui/app/api/health/route.ts, ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js app router API endpoints live under `apps/ui/app/api/*/route.ts` and can use `force-dynamic` with `Cache-Control: no-store` for monitoring endpoints
  - Version/commit metadata is accessible via `appVersionInfo()` from `apps/ui/lib/appVersion.ts`

## 2026-01-26 19:58 - US-078.3
- Added Telegram start/success/failure notifications to the deploy-nuc workflow with duration and error details.
- Documented Telegram bot setup requirements in the root README.
- Files changed: .github/workflows/deploy-nuc.yml, README.md, ralph/prd.json, ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Deploy notifications rely on TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID GitHub secrets and a configurable server name in the workflow.
  - Using a single deploy step with a bash trap captures failure details and still sends the failure notification.
