- Filtered cross-reference-only entries out of training queue selection and fallback picks.
- Verified training UI via dev-browser at `/` (bereid not present in page text).
- Files changed: apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts, apps/ui/lib/types.ts, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Training queue selection is handled in `apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts` via `get_next_word` RPC with list fallback.
  - Cross-reference-only words are identified by `cross_reference` with empty `meanings`.

- Added mobile swipe gestures (left=opnieuw, right=goed) with threshold, slide animation, and action indicator on the training card.
- Reordered mobile action buttons into two rows while preserving desktop order.
- Verified mobile layout via dev-browser (screenshot: /home/khrustal/dev/github/dev-browser/skills/dev-browser/tmp/us-031-mobile.png).
- Files changed: apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Training card swipe interactions are implemented in `apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx` via touch handlers on the card wrapper.
