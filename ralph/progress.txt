## Codebase Patterns
- `apps/ui/public/audio` is a symlink to `db/audio` for serving static audio assets.
- TTS audio is cached by `apps/ui/app/api/tts/route.ts` under `db/audio/tts` and served as `/audio/tts/<hash>.mp3`.

## 2026-01-23 18:45:32 CET - US-041-1
- Documented local and NUC audio paths, container symlink behavior, and audio URL generation points
- Files changed: `ralph/us-041-1-audio-investigation.md`, `ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: `apps/ui/public/audio` is a symlink to `db/audio`, and TTS caching returns `/audio/tts/<hash>.mp3`.
  - Gotchas encountered: the UI container on NUC currently has a broken `/app/public/audio` symlink because the host path is not mounted.
  - Useful context: word audio URLs come from `raw.audio_links?.nl` in `apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx` while sentence audio uses `/api/tts`.
