## Codebase Patterns
- For async guards that must be synchronous (prevent rapid double-submits), use a `useRef` boolean instead of relying only on React state.
- For per-card/session IDs that must persist across retries, store them in a `useRef` and set them in one place when a new card is presented (e.g., a `presentWord(...)` helper).

## 2026-02-09 22:34:45 CET - US-093.1
- Added synchronous in-flight guard (`actionLoadingRef`) to block keyboard shortcuts and swipe completion while a review submission is in progress.
- Wrapped `handleAction` in a `try/finally` so loading state is reliably cleared even if async work throws.
- UI verification skipped (not necessary for this change; covered by `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run`).
- Files changed: `apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx`
- Learnings for future iterations: If preventing double-submit matters, gate the action entrypoint itself (not only buttons/disabled UI), since React state updates are not synchronous.

## 2026-02-09 22:42:19 CET - US-093.2
- Added a per-card `turnId` (UUID) generated when a card is presented, stored in a ref, and passed into `recordReview`.
- Updated `recordReview` to accept `turnId` and attempt an RPC call with `p_turn_id`, with a backward-compatible retry without it if the backend function signature hasn't been migrated yet.
- UI verification skipped (not necessary for this change; covered by `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run`).
- Files changed: `apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx`, `apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts`, `ralph/prd.json`, `ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - If the DB migration is shipped separately from the UI, prefer a best-effort RPC call with new params plus a safe fallback to the legacy signature to avoid breaking older deployments.
  - Centralizing “card presented” logic (e.g., `presentWord`) prevents missing side effects like updating `turnId` across multiple code paths (forced load, normal load, prefetch swap).
