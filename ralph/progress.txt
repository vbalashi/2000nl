# Arch Migration Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Training UI lives at `/` via `apps/ui/app/page.tsx` (no `/training` route).
- Audio files are served via `apps/ui/public/audio` symlink to `db/audio` and referenced as `/audio/<lang>/<letter>/<hash>.mp3`.

- Filtered cross-reference-only entries out of training queue selection and fallback picks.
- Verified training UI via dev-browser at `/` (bereid not present in page text).
- Files changed: apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts, apps/ui/lib/types.ts, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Training queue selection is handled in `apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts` via `get_next_word` RPC with list fallback.
  - Cross-reference-only words are identified by `cross_reference` with empty `meanings`.

- Added mobile swipe gestures (left=opnieuw, right=goed) with threshold, slide animation, and action indicator on the training card.
- Reordered mobile action buttons into two rows while preserving desktop order.
- Verified mobile layout via dev-browser (screenshot: /home/khrustal/dev/github/dev-browser/skills/dev-browser/tmp/us-031-mobile.png).
- Files changed: apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Training card swipe interactions are implemented in `apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx` via touch handlers on the card wrapper.

- Added public audio symlink, update script, and refreshed word data audio URLs to use /audio paths.
- Updated audio download documentation with the UI URL format.
- Files changed: apps/ui/public/audio, db/data/words_content/*.json, docs/audio-download.md, ralph/prd.json, ralph/progress.txt, scripts/update-audio-urls.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Audio URLs are served from the Next.js public symlink at `apps/ui/public/audio` and should use `/audio/<lang>/<letter>/<hash>.mp3`.
  - The word JSON files include embedded audio URLs in `_raw_html`, so bulk updates should replace those strings too.
  - Browser verification of audio playback was skipped (dev server not running).
