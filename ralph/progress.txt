## Codebase Patterns
- Training UI tour anchors live on `TrainingScreen` (header/buttons) and `TrainingCard` (card/toolbar) via `data-tour` attributes.
## 2026-01-23 20:41 - US-048-1
- Added stable data-tour anchors for training card, toolbar, rating buttons, sidebar toggle, search, and settings.
- Files changed: apps/ui/components/training/TrainingCard.tsx, apps/ui/components/training/TrainingScreen.tsx, ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tour targets in the training UI are best anchored on always-rendered wrappers to avoid conditional rendering gaps.
  - Chrome DevTools MCP was unavailable (transport closed); used dev-browser for visual verification and logged the issue.
