- Filtered cross-reference-only entries out of training queue selection and fallback picks.
- Verified training UI via dev-browser at `/` (bereid not present in page text).
- Files changed: apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts, apps/ui/lib/types.ts, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Training queue selection is handled in `apps/ui/lib/trainingService.ts` via `get_next_word` RPC with list fallback.
  - Cross-reference-only words are identified by `cross_reference` with empty `meanings`.
